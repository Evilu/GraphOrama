# GraphOrama Frontend (Next.js)

This is a Next.js frontend that visualizes graph data (3D) using react-force-graph-3d and React Query.

Quick start:

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The app loads a sample JSON by default and can query your backend at `/api/graph/query` when you toggle off "Use sample JSON".
